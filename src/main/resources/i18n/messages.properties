index.resume=Resume
index.title=Java developer Anton Shelenkov
index.content1=I create intracorporate programs and client-server systems, \
  and also improve the old ones. To achieve high speed of development and easy \
  product maintenance, I use relevant frameworks and technologies. I also pay \
  special attention to automated code testing and maintaining code quality. \
  Together with robust code delivery and deployment processes, this \
  reduces development time and improves product success among end users.
index.content2=The main vector of my professional activity is backend \
  development. I know microservice architecture, I can organize site \
  security and able to build a convenient API. I can integrate the system \
  with third-party services and work with public blockchains.
index.content3=To organize an effective development process, you need to \
  configure many infrastructure elements, such as continuous integration \
  server and system monitoring tools. I am familiar with some popular \
  solutions and can create such a system for test environment. \
  But to keep your production environment safe and efficient, you \
  need a dedicated specialist. If you do not know whom to contact, \
  I can recommend a capable person.
index.content4=I try to write a code as efficiently as possible, with an eye \
  on project modification in the future. It is important for me that when my \
  colleagues see my code, they won\u2019t have a desire to rewrite it.
index.remark=The code for this project is available at \
  <a href="https://github.com/Anshelen/portfolio">GitHub</a>


about.head.title=About
about.title=About me
about.education.title=Education
about.education.content1=At the age of 15 I entered the Lyceum No. 1502 of the \
  Moscow Power Engineering Institute where studied at physical and \
  mathematical class (2010-2013). At the lyceum physics was my main hobby, and \
  I seriously intended to connect my future with it.
about.education.content2=After the lyceum I entered the Bauman Moscow State \
  University at the faculty of "Refrigeration, cryogenic technics, and air \
  conditioning and life support systems" (2013-2019). On a programming course \
  of my study we used the same Pascal with the Lazarus IDE. It allowed us to \
  develop simple graphical interfaces.
about.education.content3=Since then, I was interested in programming \
  and learned Java in my spare time. In about a year I passed a JavaRush \
  course and read several programming books, such as Bruce Eckel's "Thinking \
  in Java" and Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java". This gave me a sufficient \
  technical background to get my first job.
about.simplex-software.title=Simplex Software
about.simplex-software.content1=From 2017 to 2018, I combined study at the \
  institute with working in a small software company \
  <a class="text-warning" href="http://simplex-software.ru/">Simplex Software</a> \
  as a intern Java programmer. During this time I got acquainted with a wide \
  range of new technologies and took part in many projects (mostly web, but \
  also dealt with blockchain development). A year later, I led the project, \
  coordinating the actions of a small team containing two more developers. It \
  gave me a new experience in building applications architecture and project \
  management. However, the software in this company was often developed using \
  a well-established stack of technologies, some of which, in my opinion, were \
  obsolete.
about.iqmanager.title=IQManager
about.iqmanager.content1=Next year, in parallel with writing an institution \
  diploma, I actively studied the relevant technologies and implemented home \
  projects like this site:) I also improved algorithms knowledge and learned \
  the basics of Python, that helped me to automate my work.
about.iqmanager.content2.part1=From October 2018 to July 2019, besides working \
  on home projects, I was supporting the service dedicated to the events \
  organization
about.iqmanager.content2.part2=. On that project I was developing new \
  functionality and improving the existing one. In addition to working on \
  system backend, I participated in site frontend development (e.g., made \
  integration with Google Maps and improved user calendars).
about.aximetria.title=Aximetria
about.aximetria.content1.part1=After graduation, I worked as backend developer in a startup
about.aximetria.content1.link=Aximetria
about.aximetria.content1.part2= (September 2019 - November 2020). \
  This service gives users an opportunity to manage cryptocurrency assets. \
  On this project, I came across microservice architecture and related technologies. \
  There were about 10 people in our team, including 4 Java developers besides me. \
  We didn't have strict areas of responsibility, so I worked with almost all parts \
  of the system. Most closely I was involved in development of anti-fraud system and \
  improving Ethereum blockchain module. All year we have worked hard to improve the \
  architecture of the project and implement event-driven approach.
about.aximetria.content2.part1=I got interested in microservices, so in my spare time \
  I tried to improve my skills in this domain. As pet project, I created a microservice \
  system, deployed it to Google Cloud Platform, set up continuous delivery of code to \
  the cluster using Jenkins and monitoring with ELK stack. You can read about this project \
  in more detail in my
about.aximetria.content2.link=series of articles
about.today.title=At present
about.today.content1=Today I am interested in the backend development of high-load \
  applications. In the future, I would like to participate in creating large-scale \
  systems based on microservice architecture.

projects.head.title=Portfolio
projects.title=Projects I participated in
projects.aximetria.title=<a href="https://www.aximetria.com" target="_blank" \
  class="text-warning">Aximetria</a> - crypto account
projects.aximetria.content1=This service allows making transactions with fiat and cryptocurrency \
  assets. Users can create wallets, buy or sell cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, transfer funds \
  to external addresses. Also, customers can participate in the referral program and buy tariffs \
  to gain advanced functionality access.
projects.aximetria.content2=The system consists of 14 microservices built on Spring stack \
  and exchanging information via Apache Kafka and RPC (Apache Thrift). I worked with almost \
  all parts of the system, but most closely I was involved in development of anti-fraud system\
  and Ethereum blockchain module. Some of the tasks that I have solved in this project:
projects.aximetria.challenge1=Created anti-fraud algorithm for comparing user's full name with \
  cardholder's data, considering transliteration, compound names, typos, abbreviations, etc.
projects.aximetria.challenge2=Designed subsidize transactions system that allowed users to \
  transfer stablecoins without blockchain commissions
projects.aximetria.challenge3=Integrated with external video verification service and \
  improved user identity system
projects.aximetria.challenge4=Created convenient aggregated data views in ClickHouse, \
  which made working with analytics faster and easier
projects.iqmanager.title=<a href="https://iqmanager.org" target="_blank" \
  class="text-warning">IQManager</a> - a service for organizing events
projects.iqmanager.content1=This project is dedicated to agregate artists, \
  musicians, owners of venues and other employees of the entertainment \
  industry directly with the customer. The user can act both as a customer and \
  as an performer. The system allows the client to organize an event online, \
  even without the need to call the performer.
projects.iqmanager.content2=Some of the tasks I solved:
projects.iqmanager.challenge1=Develop user calendars in Javascript, add and \
  customize Google Maps
projects.iqmanager.challenge2=Integrate with Sberbank acquiring, implement \
  partial payments and automatic refunds
projects.iqmanager.challenge3=Profile and eliminate system bottlenecks that \
  has accelerated the loading time of some pages by an order
projects.iqmanager.challenge4=Improve full-text search on site - set up fuzzy \
  search, modify search criteria, analyze indexes
projects.arbitr.title=Arbitr - parser of \
  <a href="http://kad.arbitr.ru/" target="_blank" class="text-warning">administrative cases archive</a>
projects.arbitr.content1=This parser can extract information using provided \
  TIN list in two modes: historical and incremental. Historical mode is \
  initiated by the user and parses cases that appeared or were modified during \
  specified period of time, while an incremental mode is launched regularly in \
  automatic mode.
projects.arbitr.content2=The main technical challenge in this project was to \
  bypass the site parsing-protection system. This problem was solved by using \
  proxy servers and captcha decryption service \
  <a href="https://rucaptcha.com/" target="_blank" class="text-warning">Rucaptcha.com</a>. \
  Moreover, this program actively uses multithreading.
projects.arbitr.content3=During development, my responsibilities included \
  developing the architecture of the program, as well as coordinating the work \
  of two more programmers. It was a very useful and interesting experience.
projects.talksift.title=Forum <a href="http://talksift.ru/" target="_blank" \
  class="text-warning">Talksift</a>
projects.talksift.content=Talksift is a discussion platform for debating on \
  any topic. It has a very intricate system of filters, ratings and \
  conversations. Working on this project gave me experience with very large \
  database queries and confusing project navigation.
projects.pajcoin.title=<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a85180ce3012e7715b913dd585afdf1a10f3025" \
  target="_blank" class="text-warning">PajCoin</a> - Ethereum-based token
projects.pajcoin.content=The project consists of three components: token, the \
  exchanger smart contract and oracle service. The token maintains ERC223 \
  standard and is tied to the ruble (1 PJC token = 1000 rubles). For token \
  purchase/sale the exchanger is used, the rate of which is externally \
  corrected by the oracle service. For this service originally the Oraclize \
  was used, however, subsequently, for economic reasons, it was decided to \
  develop our own oracle implementation. It allowed to significantly reduce \
  operating cost (about 4 times) and, as a consequence, the exchanger \
  commission. I took part in the development of all components of that system.
projects.changer.title=Changer - closed joint-stock platform for Bitcoin and \
  Ethereum
projects.changer.content=This program allows investors to transfer \
  cryptocurrency to the company's wallet and monitor it in their personal \
  accounts. Administrators can automatically distribute dividends in \
  proportion to deposits. In a development team I was responsible for \
  automatic testing of this application, because product owner had high \
  requirements for data consistency and reliability. As a result, I wrote \
  tests using TestRPC and private blockchain.
